# Copywriting: Voice & Tone Guidelines

The **Luxe** brand speaks with an air of sophisticated mystery and exclusivity.

## Brand Personality
* **Timeless**: Uses words like "Elegance", "Craftsmanship", "Essence".
* **Exclusive**: Emphasizes rarity ("Private Circle", "Curated Excellence").
* **Sensory**: Focuses on the physical experience ("Liquid", "Depth", "Clarity").
* **Minimalist**: Short, impactful headlines. "Redefining Luxury".

## Grammar & Copy Rules
* **Headings:** Title Case. Often uses a `<span>` to highlight a single keyword in `var(--color-primary)`.
* **Descriptions:** poetic but concise. Avoid "salesy" language (e.g., "Buy Now!", "Best Prices!"). Use "Explore", "Discover", "Request Access".
* **Buttons:** Uppercase text with wide spacing (`letter-spacing: 0.2em`).
